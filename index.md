# Hi! I'm Aashish Khubchandani! 

## Welcome to my homepage! 

I studied Physics and Computer Science at New York University and have worked in a predictive analytics lab. I enjoy breaking down complex problems, and have a passion for working with data and thinking from first principles. 

At New York University, I worked as a Course Assistant (for Data Structures and Predictive Analytics classes), as well as a tutor (for Java Object-Oriented Programming and General Physics) at NYU. I'm skilled in Python, Java, C, and the ability to learn new languages and understand new environments quickly and deeply. I will soon be starting as an Analyst at Goldman Sachs, where my responsibilities on a Strateges team will focus on creating and maintaining financial software products in Goldman Sachs' Asset Management Division.

My other interests include playing the piano, reading, and classical music.
