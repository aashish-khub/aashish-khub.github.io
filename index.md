# Hi! I'm Aashish Khubchandani! 

## Welcome to my homepage! 

I'm a student of Physics and Computer Science at New York University, working in a predictive analytics lab with a love for breaking down complex problems, and a passion for working with data and thinking from first principles.

I'm currently employed as a Course Assistant (for Data Structures and Predictive Analytics classes), as well as a tutor (for Java Object-Oriented Programming and General Physics) at NYU. I'm skilled in Python, Java, C, SQL, and the ability to learn new languages and understand new environments quickly and deeply.

My other interests include playing the piano, reading, and classical music.
