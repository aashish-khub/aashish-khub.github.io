# Hi! I'm Aashish Khubchandani! 

## Welcome to my homepage! 

I studied Physics and Computer Science at New York University, where I worked in a predictive analytics lab. I enjoy breaking down complex problems, and have a passion for working with data and thinking from first principles. I'm particularly fascinated by the systems aspect of the challenges posed by working with big data.

At New York University, I worked as a Course Assistant (for General Physics and Data Structures classes), as well as a tutor (for Java Object-Oriented Programming and General Physics). I'm skilled in Python, Java, C, and at learning new languages and understanding new environments quickly and deeply. 

I work as a Quantitative Software Developer (Strategist) at Goldman Sachs Asset Management, where my responsibilities on the Fundamental Equities Strategies team involve creating and maintaining robust financial tools using well-engineered data pipelines in order to help drive effective investments and enhance risk management and analytics.

My other interests include playing the piano, reading, classical music, and roller skating.
