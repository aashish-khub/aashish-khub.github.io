# Hi! I'm Aashish Khubchandani! 

## Welcome to my homepage! 

I'm a Computer Science graduate student at **Cornell Tech**.

From 2022 to 2024, I worked as a quantitative software developer at **Goldman Sachs** on the Fundamental Equities Strategies team within the Asset Management division. I created and maintained financial tools and engineered data pipelines that drove effective investments and improved risk management.

From 2018 to 2022, I studied Physics and Computer Science at **New York University**. There, I worked in an applied machine learning lab deploying real-world machine learning and big data applications focused on the impacts of COVID-19. I also served as a Course Assistant for General Physics and Data Structures and tutored in Physics and Computer Science.

I'm skilled in Python, Java, and C, and I quickly adapt to new languages and environments. I'm currently interested in machine learning and software engineering. I'm always looking for new opportunities to learn and grow. 

My other interests include hiking, roller skating, and classical music.
