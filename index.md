# Hi! I'm Aashish Khubchandani! 

## Welcome to my homepage! 

I'm a Computer Science graduate student at **Cornell Tech**. 

From 2022 to 2024, I worked as a quantitative software developer at **Goldman Sachs**, where my responsibilities on the Fundamental Equities Strategies team within the Asset Management division included creating and maintaining robust financial tools using well-engineered data pipelines in order to help drive effective investments and enhance risk management and analytics.

From 2018 to 2022, I studied Physics and Computer Science at **New York University**, where I worked in a predictive analytics lab. I also worked as a Course Assistant (for General Physics and Data Structures classes), as well as a tutor (for Java Object-Oriented Programming and General Physics). I'm skilled in Python, Java, C, and at learning new languages and understanding new environments quickly and deeply. 

My other interests include hiking, roller skating, and classical music.
